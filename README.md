# Setup and installation
.configure and run the project locally

# Known Bugs
I personally created the link to products but was unable to link all the products so that when the user presses that button it enables him or her to go to the products themselves for easier accessibility
# Technology used
Personally i have used:1.html
                        2.css
                        3.js
